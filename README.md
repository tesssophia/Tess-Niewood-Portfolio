# Tess-Niewood-Portfolio
Tess Niewood's publically available portfolio of visualizations, developed for Telling Stories With Data Course, Spring 2022. 

# About Me
I'm a 2nd year Master's student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon studying healthcare analytics.  Before starting at CMU I was a healthcare strategy consultant and worked with midsized payers and providrs.  I'm a healthcare data geek, but I'm especially passionate about using data to improve maternal healthcare, improve access to care for marginalized populations, and structure contracts and payments in a way that targets the healthcare "triple aim." 

# What I Hope to Learn
Through this course, I hope to improve my ability to communicate my analytic findings for clients, colleagues and patients.  When I graduate in May, I hope to join a small healthcare service startup where I'll be able to leverage my strategy background and data skills.  Communicating insights and analysis will be a key part of that role, so I know the skills I learn in this course will be helpful.
