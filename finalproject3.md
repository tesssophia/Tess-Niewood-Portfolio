# Overview
My project looks to educate the viewer about Medicaid coverage, and new legislation that will allow states to extend postpartum coverage to a full year. I focused on Pennsylvania residents, but hoped to make the report generally accessible and interesting to anyone in states that haven't yet formally extended coverage (Pennsylvania legislature has announced plans to extend coverage, but no legislation has been passed yet).

# Changes and updates
Since getting feedback on my draft storyboard and wireframes, I've implemented several changes:
- I cleaned up the charts depicting proportions of Black women and rural women being covered by Medicaid, putting them into the same format and simplifying to amplify my main point
- I used colors to subtly depict the different sections of the report
- Changed the map projections to one more suitable to showing the entire US
- Varied the sizes and placements of the chart to emphasize those that my users thought were most impactful
- I fleshed out the sourcing, text information and the call to action section

# Summary and reflection
Overall, I feel that the final project portrays a clear story with supporting data and a main point.  Maternal health is an area I am passionate about, and this shares a piece of that with a broader audience.  The final charts definitely benefited from my user research, and are simple to understand while still being informative.
One aspect I struggled with was the appropriate aesthetic for the report.  On the one hand, I believe that this is an issue of life or death for many women across the country.  I also did not want the project to "play" with the emotions of the reader by being overly graphic or emotional.  I have stuck with my earlier choice to minimze graphics and focus only on the data visualizations for this reason - to let the informaion speak for itself.  

# Data sources
I used several references for specific pieces of information that are cited on my shorthand site, but I want to call out here my primary data source, which is the CDC Wonder database.  The data can be accessed [here](https://wonder.cdc.gov/natality-expanded-current.html), and the formal citation is:
> United States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS),
> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
> National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS),
> Division of Vital Statistics,
> Natality public-use data on CDC WONDER Online Database,
> for years 2016-2020 (expanded), available October 2021
