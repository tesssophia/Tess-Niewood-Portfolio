# Overview
My project looks to educate the viewer about Medicaid coverage, and new legislation that will allow states to extend postpartum coverage to a full year. I focused on Pennsylvania residents, but hoped to make the report generally accessible and interesting to anyone in states that haven't yet formally extended coverage (Pennsylvania legislature has announced plans to extend coverage, but no legislation has been passed yet).

# Changes and updates
Since getting feedback on my draft storyboard and wireframes, I've implemented several changes:
- I cleaned up the charts depicting proportions of Black women and rural women being covered by Medicaid, putting them into the same format and simplifying to amplify my main point
- I used colors to subtly depict the different sections of the report
- Changed the map projections to one more suitable to showing the entire US
- Varied the sizes and placements of the chart to emphasize those that my users thought were most impactful
- I fleshed out the sourcing, text information and the call to action section

# Summary and reflection
