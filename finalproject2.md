# Wireframes & story boards
I used a draft of my final project in shorthand for my user research.  That draft can be found [here](/https://preview.shorthand.com/rHTAaLvK4tVfFzv3)

# User research
I chose the following questions to help guide my interviews (although I didn't stick to a script that strictly)
- What is your first impression from looking at the website?
- Which chart is most striking?
- What’s one thing that is unclear?
- What’s one thing you learned?

## Interview #1
Interviewee: 85 year old female retired teacher and public worker

This interview was very prescriptive, and I worked hard to dig deeper into the motivations behind the suggestions.  A couple that were helpful:
- In the pair of pie charts that show the proportion of Black mothers served by Medicaid and Private Payers the main message of the chart isn't clear
- The interviewee was very adament that they wanted to see the proportion of non-rural births as well.  I realized that the chart is hard to read since the labels and text aren't dark enough, making it unclear that it's a proportion. 
- Originally I used a Tableau map that used a different map projection making Alaska look quite large.  This was distracting and unclear

Things that worked well included:
- The interviewee felt they learned more about the policy - they hadn't been aware that states had the option to extend funding
- The interviewee was surprised at the disproportionate number of non-rural mothers covered by Medicaid.  They had expected the sheer volume in urban areas to counteract this

## Interview #2
