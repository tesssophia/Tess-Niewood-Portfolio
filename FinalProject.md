# The Importance of Medicaid Coverage for Maternal Health in the US

## Project Outline

1. Project Overview 

Between 2016 and 2020 State funded Medicaid covered 42% of births in the US.  States are required to continue coverage for 60 days, but new legislation would allow states to encourage coverage to one year post-partum.  While generally insurance coverage is associated with better health outcomes, this population in particular can benefit from the expanded coverage.
