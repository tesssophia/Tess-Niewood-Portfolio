# The Importance of Medicaid Coverage for Maternal Health in the US

## Project Outline

1. Project Overview 

Between 2016 and 2020 State funded Medicaid covered 42% of births in the US.  States are required to continue coverage for 60 days, but new legislation would allow states to encourage coverage to one year post-partum.  While generally insurance coverage is associated with better health outcomes, this population in particular can benefit from the expanded coverage.

## Method and Medium

I plan to use my github portfolio for my final project.  In this way I can leverage my new understanding of how to use a git-hub personal website, and keep all of my work in one place. I will create a new clean page and leverage embedding and formatting to create a comprehensible and interesting story.
